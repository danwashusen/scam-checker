# review-story-implementation

Ultra think to perform comprehensive code review of story implementation with detailed, educational feedback focused on improving junior developer skills and ensuring code quality standards.

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_path: 'Path to story file being reviewed'
  - implementation_plan_path: 'Path to {story-filename}-implementation-plan.md'
optional:
  - focus_areas: 'Specific areas to emphasize in review (e.g., security, performance, testing)'
```

## Prerequisites

- Story status must be "Ready for Review"
- Implementation plan file must exist
- File List in story must be complete and non-empty
- All tasks and subtasks should be marked as completed

## Review Process

### 1. Context Loading and Validation

**Load Required Context:**

- Read the story file completely to understand requirements and acceptance criteria
- Load the implementation plan to understand the intended approach
- Read all files listed in the story's File List section
- Load all architecture documents to have a clear understanding of the entire system

**Interface/UI Documentation Check (Technology-Agnostic):**

If the story involves ANY user interface or client-facing changes (web, mobile, desktop):

- Read any consolidated UI specs (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md`) if present, without assuming web-only context
- Read UI/client-related files in `docs/architecture/` (look for: frontend, ui, client, web, mobile, ios, android, desktop, electron, view, component, design)
- Review implementation against established UI/client patterns and requirements
- Include UI/client consistency as a key review criterion
- Check for:
  - Proper component/view structure and reusability
  - Consistent styling/appearance approach for the platform
  - Appropriate state management
  - Responsiveness/adaptivity across form factors
  - Accessibility considerations for the target platform

**Validate Review Readiness:**

- Confirm story status is "Ready for Review"
- Verify implementation plan exists and is complete
- Check that File List contains actual modified/created files
- Ensure all tasks/subtasks are marked [x] as completed
- Scan for newly introduced dependencies and verify they are explicitly approved in the plan's Dependency Policy
- Verify file and test locations comply with `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`; flag any nonconforming paths

**HALT if validation fails** - request developer address issues before review

### 2. Comprehensive Code Analysis

#### A. Implementation Alignment Review

- Code that breaks existing functionality
- Violations of core architectural principles

#### 🟡 SHOULD IMPROVE (Quality Issues)

- Code clarity and maintainability issues
- Minor performance improvements
- Better error handling approaches
- Improved test coverage
- Code organization improvements

#### 🟢 CONSIDER FOR FUTURE (Learning Opportunities)

- Quality improvements over previous work

### 4. Detailed Feedback Format

For each feedback item, provide:

**Problem Description:**

- Clear explanation of the issue or observation
- Why it matters (impact on maintainability, performance, security, etc.)

**Current Code Example:**

```typescript
// Current implementation that needs improvement
const userData = await getUserData(userId);
if (userData) {
  return userData.profile;
}
```

**Improved Code Example:**

```typescript
// Improved implementation with error handling
try {
  const userData = await getUserData(userId);
  if (!userData) {
    throw new NotFoundError(`User ${userId} not found`);
  }
  return userData.profile;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch user data', { userId, error });
  throw error;
}
```

**Learning Points:**

- Explanation of why the improvement is better
- General principles that apply beyond this specific case
- References to documentation or best practices

**Priority Level:**

- Must Fix / Should Improve / Consider for Future
- Estimated effort (Low/Medium/High)

**Review Completion Checklist:**

- [ ] All files in File List reviewed
- [ ] Implementation plan compliance checked
- [ ] Security review completed
- [ ] Performance assessment done
- [ ] Test coverage evaluated
- [ ] Documentation reviewed
- [ ] Feedback categorized and prioritized
- [ ] Story updated with review section
- [ ] Next steps clearly defined

**Status Recommendations:**

- "Changes Required" - if Must Fix issues exist
- "Minor Improvements Needed" - only Should Improve items
- "Approved with Suggestions" - mostly good with future considerations
- "Excellent Work" - high quality implementation

Block approval if:

- Traceability is broken for any AC
- Unapproved dependencies are introduced
- Significant deviations from the plan lack Plan Amendments and rationale
- File/test locations violate `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`

## Key Principles

- **Educational Focus**: Every piece of feedback should help the developer learn and grow
- **Specific Examples**: Always provide concrete code examples, not just abstract criticism
- **Balanced Feedback**: Include positive observations alongside areas for improvement
- **Actionable Guidance**: Each suggestion should include clear steps for implementation
- **Context Awareness**: Consider the developer's experience level and learning trajectory
- **Standards Alignment**: Ensure feedback aligns with project coding standards and patterns
- **Constructive Tone**: Frame feedback as learning opportunities rather than failures

## Blocking Conditions

Stop the review and request clarification if:

- Implementation plan is missing or incomplete
- File List is empty or doesn't match actual changes
- Story requirements are unclear or contradictory
- Code changes appear to break existing functionality
- Security concerns require immediate attention
- Implementation deviates significantly from plan without explanation

## Completion

After review completion:

#### G. Traceability and Dependency Compliance

- Verify AC → test IDs → modules mapping is complete and accurate (Traceability Matrix)
- Flag any implemented code or tests that lack traceability to ACs
- Identify any unapproved dependencies introduced (blockers)
- Verify deviations from plan include Plan Amendments with rationale

#### H. Project Structure Compliance

- Validate that all source and test files follow `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`
- Check file/folder naming conventions and placement of tests
- Flag generic default structures (e.g., `__tests__`) if not defined in the project structure

### 3.a Review Rubric (Technology-Agnostic)

- Architecture compliance and separation of concerns
- Plan compliance and completeness of traceability
- Dependency adherence (no unapproved additions)
- Error handling and failure-path coverage
- Observability (logs/metrics/traces) where applicable
- Security and performance considerations
- Accessibility and responsiveness/adaptivity (for UI/client stories)

1. Update story with comprehensive Dev Review Feedback section
2. Provide clear next steps and priorities
3. Offer to discuss complex issues in detail
4. Schedule follow-up review if needed
5. Recognize good work and improvement efforts
6. Suggest relevant learning resources for continued growth
