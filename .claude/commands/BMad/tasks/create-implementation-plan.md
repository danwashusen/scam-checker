# Create Implementation Plan Task

## Purpose

Ultra think to generate an extremely detailed, prescriptive implementation plan that enables less advanced models to execute story development without making complex architectural decisions. This task leverages models with superior reasoning capabilities to create comprehensive technical guidance.

IMPORTANT: The implementation plan MUST be technology-specific and align with the project's preferred stack and standards. Pull platform, language, framework, testing, and tooling details from authoritative sources (see 1.4). Specify exact modules, file paths, public APIs, framework conventions, build/test tools, and dependency versions so a junior developer can implement without making architectural decisions.

## CRITICAL Prerequisites

- **Story Status**: Target story must exist and be in "Approved" status
- **Architecture Context**: All relevant architecture documents must be accessible

## SEQUENTIAL Task Execution

**IMPORTANT WORKFLOW NOTE**:

- For new implementation plans: Execute sections 1, 3.1-3.9 to generate complete plan
- Upon user acceptance of plan: Immediately execute section 3.10 to save file
- For existing plan re-evaluation: Execute sections 1, 2 to update existing plan file

### 1. Verify Planning Mode and Context

#### 1.1 Confirm Planning Mode

- Always tell the user that you are attempting to generate an enhanced implementation plan before proceeding further
- Verify that we are operating in planning mode
- If not in planning mode, HALT and instruct: "This task requires planning mode. Please enable planning mode before proceeding."

#### 1.2 Load Target Story

- Identify the target story file from user input
- Load and validate story structure and status
- Ensure story has complete Acceptance Criteria and basic Tasks/Subtasks
- Extract story context, requirements, and existing Dev Notes

#### 1.3 Check for Existing Implementation Plan

- **CRITICAL**: Check if implementation plan file already exists
- Implementation plan file naming convention: `{story-filename}-implementation-plan.md`
- Example: For `story-2-1-multi-factor-scoring-algorithm.md`, check for `story-2-1-multi-factor-scoring-algorithm-implementation-plan.md`
- If implementation plan exists:
  - Load existing implementation plan content
  - Note creation date and last modification time
  - Proceed to re-evaluation workflow (Section 2)
- If implementation plan does not exist:
  - Proceed to new implementation plan generation workflow (Section 3)
  - Plan will be saved to new file upon completion

#### 1.4 Load Architecture Context

- Load all architecture documents to have a clear understanding of the entire system
- Specifically load files from `bmad-core/core-config.yaml` → `devLoadAlwaysFiles` (e.g., `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md`, `coding-standards.md`, `unified-project-structure.md`, `source-tree.md`, `development-workflow.md`)
- If available, include platform-specific files in `docs/architecture/` (web, mobile, desktop/service)
- If provided, incorporate preferences from `bmad-core/data/technical-preferences.md`
- Extract existing code patterns, conventions, and technical standards
- Identify relevant languages, frameworks, test frameworks, build tools, and design patterns already in use
- Record the authoritative sources used (file names) in the plan's Metadata section
- Use `unified-project-structure.md` as the source of truth for all file/folder paths (including test file locations) and override any generic defaults (e.g., do NOT assume `__tests__` unless explicitly defined there)

**Interface/UI Documentation Check (Technology-Agnostic):**

If the story involves ANY user interface or client-facing changes (web, mobile, desktop):

- Read relevant UI/client documentation under `docs/architecture/` (look for: frontend, ui, client, web, mobile, ios, android, desktop, electron, view, component, design)
- If present, also read any consolidated UI specs (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md`) without assuming web-only context
- Incorporate platform-appropriate patterns and requirements into the plan:
  - Component/view architecture and reusability patterns
  - Styling/appearance conventions appropriate to the platform
  - State management approaches
  - Input handling and validation patterns
  - Responsiveness/adaptivity across form factors
  - Accessibility standards applicable to the target platform
- Ensure the plan aligns with the established UI/client architecture for the project

### 2. Re-Evaluate Existing Implementation Plan (If Plan File Exists)

#### 2.4 Updated Plan Output

- Create updated implementation plan with:
  - Original plan sections (preserved for context)
  - "Plan Amendments" section with specific updates
  - "Implementation Status" section tracking completion
  - Updated metadata (last reviewed date, amendments made)

## Notes

- This task should typically take 15-30 minutes to complete thoroughly

- Focus on being prescriptive rather than descriptive - tell Sonnet 4 exactly what to do, not what to consider
- When in doubt, be more detailed rather than less detailed
