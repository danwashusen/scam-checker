# review-story-implementation

Ultra think to perform comprehensive code review of story implementation with detailed, educational feedback focused on improving junior developer skills and ensuring code quality standards.

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_path: 'Path to story file being reviewed'
  - implementation_plan_path: 'Path to {story-filename}-implementation-plan.md'
optional:
  - focus_areas: 'Specific areas to emphasize in review (e.g., security, performance, testing)'
```

## Prerequisites

- Story status must be "Ready for Review"
- Implementation plan file must exist
- File List in story must be complete and non-empty
- All tasks and subtasks should be marked as completed

## Review Process

### 1. Context Loading and Validation

**Load Required Context:**

- Read the story file completely to understand requirements and acceptance criteria
- Load the implementation plan to understand the intended approach
- Read all files listed in the story's File List section
- Load all architecture documents to have a clear understanding of the entire system

**Interface/UI Documentation Check (Technology-Agnostic):**

If the story involves ANY user interface or client-facing changes (web, mobile, desktop):

- Read any consolidated UI specs (e.g., `docs/front-end-spec.md`) if present, without assuming web-only context
- Read UI/client-related files in `docs/architecture/` (look for: frontend, ui, client, web, mobile, ios, android, desktop, electron, view, component, design)
- Review implementation against established UI/client patterns and requirements
- Include UI/client consistency as a key review criterion
- Check for:
  - Proper component/view structure and reusability
  - Consistent styling/appearance approach for the platform
  - Appropriate state management
  - Responsiveness/adaptivity across form factors
  - Accessibility considerations for the target platform

**Validate Review Readiness:**

- Confirm story status is "Ready for Review"
- Verify implementation plan exists and is complete
- Check that File List contains actual modified/created files
- Ensure all tasks/subtasks are marked [x] as completed
- Scan for newly introduced dependencies and verify they are explicitly approved in the plan's Dependency Policy
- Verify file and test locations comply with `docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md`; flag any nonconforming paths

**HALT if validation fails** - request developer address issues before review

### 2. Comprehensive Code Analysis

**Current Code Example:**

```typescript
// Current implementation that needs improvement
const userData = await getUserData(userId);
if (userData) {
  return userData.profile;
}
```

**Improved Code Example:**

```typescript
// Improved implementation with error handling
try {
  const userData = await getUserData(userId);
  if (!userData) {
    throw new NotFoundError(`User ${userId} not found`);
  }
  return userData.profile;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch user data', { userId, error });
  throw error;
}
```

**Learning Points:**

- Explanation of why the improvement is better
- General principles that apply beyond this specific case
- References to documentation or best practices
