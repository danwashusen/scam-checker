# review-story-implementation

Perform comprehensive code review of story implementation with detailed, educational feedback focused on improving junior developer skills and ensuring code quality standards.

## Inputs

```yaml
required:
  - story_path: 'Path to story file being reviewed'
  - implementation_plan_path: 'Path to {story-filename}-implementation-plan.md'
optional:
  - focus_areas: 'Specific areas to emphasize in review (e.g., security, performance, testing)'
```

## Prerequisites

- Story status must be "Ready for Review"
- Implementation plan file must exist
- File List in story must be complete and non-empty
- All tasks and subtasks should be marked as completed

## Review Process

### 1. Context Loading and Validation

**Load Required Context:**

- Read the story file completely to understand requirements and acceptance criteria
- Load the implementation plan to understand the intended approach
- Read all files listed in the story's File List section
- Load all architecture documents to have a clear understanding of the entire system

**UI Documentation Check:**

If story involves ANY UI/front-end changes:

- **MUST** read `docs/front-end-spec.md` if it exists
- **MUST** read any UI/front-end related files in `docs/`
- Review implementation against established UI patterns and requirements
- Include UI consistency as a key review criterion
- Check for:
  - Proper component structure and reusability
  - Consistent styling approach
  - Appropriate state management
  - Responsive design implementation
  - Accessibility considerations

**Validate Review Readiness:**

- Confirm story status is "Ready for Review"
- Verify implementation plan exists and is complete
- Check that File List contains actual modified/created files
- Ensure all tasks/subtasks are marked [x] as completed

**HALT if validation fails** - request developer address issues before review

### 2. Comprehensive Code Analysis

- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection
- CSRF protection where applicable

#### E. Testing Evaluation

- Test coverage adequacy
- Test quality and maintainability
- Edge case coverage
- Integration test appropriateness
- Mock usage effectiveness
- Test data management

#### F. Documentation Assessment

- Code comments quality and necessity
- README updates if needed
- API documentation completeness
- Inline documentation for complex logic

### 3. Educational Feedback Generation

### 4. Detailed Feedback Format

For each feedback item, provide:

**Problem Description:**

- Clear explanation of the issue or observation
- Why it matters (impact on maintainability, performance, security, etc.)

**Current Code Example:**

```typescript
// Current implementation that needs improvement
const userData = await getUserData(userId);
if (userData) {
  return userData.profile;
}
```

**Improved Code Example:**

```typescript
// Improved implementation with error handling
try {
  const userData = await getUserData(userId);
  if (!userData) {
    throw new NotFoundError(`User ${userId} not found`);
  }
  return userData.profile;
} catch (error) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch user data', { userId, error });
  throw error;
}
```

**Learning Points:**

- Explanation of why the improvement is better
- General principles that apply beyond this specific case
- References to documentation or best practices

**Priority Level:**

- Must Fix / Should Improve / Consider for Future
- Estimated effort (Low/Medium/High)
