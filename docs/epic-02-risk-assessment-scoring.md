# Epic 2: Risk Assessment & Scoring

## Epic Goal

Implement intelligent risk assessment by combining domain analysis, SSL data, reputation scores, and AI content analysis into a unified 0-100 scoring system with color-coded risk levels and detailed explanations.

## Epic Description

**System Context:**
- Builds upon Epic 1's URL analysis foundation
- Integrates OpenAI/Claude API for content analysis
- Requires sophisticated scoring algorithm
- Supports both simple and technical user views

**Enhancement Details:**

This epic creates the core intelligence of the scam checker by implementing multi-factor scoring that combines technical indicators with AI-powered content analysis to generate accurate risk assessments.

**What's being built:**
- Multi-factor scoring algorithm combining domain age, SSL quality, reputation data
- AI content analysis using OpenAI/Claude API to detect scam patterns
- Weighted scoring system with configurable parameters
- Risk categorization (Green/Yellow/Red) with threshold management
- Detailed explanation generation for both technical and non-technical users
- Confidence scoring and uncertainty handling

**Success criteria:**
- Accurate 0-100 risk scores generated from multiple data sources
- AI content analysis identifies common scam patterns
- Risk levels properly categorized with appropriate thresholds
- Clear explanations provided for all risk assessments
- Scoring algorithm handles edge cases and missing data
- System provides confidence indicators for assessments

## Stories

1. **Story 2-1:** Multi-Factor Scoring Algorithm - Implement weighted scoring system combining domain, SSL, and reputation data
2. **Story 2-2:** AI Content Analysis Integration - Integrate AI APIs for content-based scam pattern detection
3. **Story 2-3:** Risk Categorization & Thresholds - Implement color-coded risk levels with configurable thresholds
4. **Story 2-4:** Explanation Generation System - Generate user-appropriate explanations for risk assessments
5. **Story 2-5:** Confidence & Uncertainty Handling - Implement confidence scoring and handle incomplete data scenarios

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] Scoring algorithm supports weighted combination of multiple factors
- [ ] AI integration with proper prompt engineering for scam detection
- [ ] Configurable risk thresholds for Green/Yellow/Red categorization
- [ ] Dynamic explanation generation based on contributing factors
- [ ] Confidence scoring reflects data completeness and reliability
- [ ] Graceful handling of missing or unreliable data sources
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time scoring

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** AI API costs and rate limiting affecting user experience
- **Mitigation:** Implement smart caching, request batching, and fallback scoring without AI
- **Rollback Plan:** System can operate with technical analysis only if AI components fail
