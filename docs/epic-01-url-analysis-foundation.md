# Epic 1: URL Analysis Foundation

## Epic Goal

Establish the core technical infrastructure for URL analysis by implementing domain validation, WHOIS data retrieval, SSL certificate analysis, and basic reputation checking to create the foundation for scam detection.

## Epic Description

**System Context:**
- New Next.js web application for scam URL detection
- Technology stack: Next.js, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components
- External API integrations required for comprehensive analysis
- In-memory caching for performance optimization

**Enhancement Details:**

This epic establishes the foundational technical capabilities needed to analyze URLs for potential scam indicators. It focuses on the backend analysis engine that will power all user-facing features.

**What's being built:**
- URL validation and parsing system
- WHOIS API integration for domain age analysis
- SSL certificate quality assessment
- Basic reputation checking via VirusTotal/URLVoid APIs
- Caching layer for API results
- Error handling and rate limiting

**Success criteria:**
- URLs can be validated and parsed correctly
- Domain age data retrieved and processed
- SSL certificate quality assessed
- Reputation data gathered from multiple sources
- API responses cached for performance
- System handles errors gracefully

## Stories

1. **Story 1-1:** URL Validation & Parsing System - Implement robust URL validation, parsing, and sanitization
2. **Story 1-2:** WHOIS Integration & Domain Age Analysis - Integrate WHOIS API to retrieve and analyze domain registration data
3. **Story 1-3:** SSL Certificate Analysis - Implement SSL certificate validation and quality assessment
4. **Story 1-4:** Reputation API Integration - Integrate VirusTotal and URLVoid for basic reputation checking
5. **Story 1-5:** Caching & Performance Layer - Implement in-memory caching for API results with TTL management

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] URL parsing handles edge cases and malformed inputs
- [ ] WHOIS data extraction and standardization across providers
- [ ] SSL certificate chain validation and scoring
- [ ] Multiple reputation API integration with fallback handling
- [ ] Caching system with appropriate TTL based on data type
- [ ] Rate limiting and API quota management
- [ ] Comprehensive error handling and logging

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** External API dependencies causing service failures
- **Mitigation:** Implement fallback providers, circuit breakers, and graceful degradation
- **Rollback Plan:** Feature flags allow disabling individual analysis components

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests cover all analysis components
- [ ] Integration tests validate external API interactions
- [ ] Error scenarios handled gracefully
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Documentation includes API integration details
