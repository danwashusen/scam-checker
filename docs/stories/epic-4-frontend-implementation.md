## Component Analysis

### Required shadcn/ui Components
```bash
# Primary navigation and layout
npx shadcn@latest add navigation-menu sheet

# Forms and inputs  
npx shadcn@latest add form input button

# Display and feedback
npx shadcn@latest add tabs card badge alert toast skeleton

# Interactive elements
npx shadcn@latest add dialog popover tooltip progress

# Data display
npx shadcn@latest add table accordion separator

# Additional utilities
npx shadcn@latest add scroll-area aspect-ratio
```

### Custom Components (Justified)
1. **Risk Score Gauge**: Custom animated circular progress - shadcn Progress doesn't support circular design
2. **Analysis Timeline**: Custom component for step-by-step progress - no shadcn equivalent
3. **Code Block with Syntax Highlighting**: Enhanced beyond shadcn capabilities for API docs

## Compatibility Requirements

- [x] **Backend APIs**: All existing `/api/analyze` functionality remains unchanged
- [x] **Database Schema**: No database changes required (using existing cache interface)
- [x] **UI Patterns**: Follow established Next.js App Router and shadcn/ui patterns
- [x] **Performance**: Minimal impact on existing backend performance
- [x] **Type Safety**: Shared TypeScript interfaces between frontend/backend

## Risk Mitigation

**Primary Risk:** Frontend-backend integration complexity causing broken user workflows
**Mitigation:** 
- Incremental integration with feature flags
- Comprehensive error boundaries and fallback states
- Thorough testing of API integration points
- Graceful degradation for service failures

**Secondary Risk:** Performance degradation from new UI components
**Mitigation:**
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization
- Lazy loading for non-critical components
- Performance testing at each story completion
- Core Web Vitals monitoring

**Rollback Plan:** 
- Git-based rollback to previous working state
- Feature flags to disable new functionality
- Separate deployment of frontend/backend allows independent rollbacks
