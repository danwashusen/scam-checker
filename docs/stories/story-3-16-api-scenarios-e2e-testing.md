# Story 3-16: API Scenarios E2E Testing

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a quality assurance engineer**, **I want comprehensive E2E testing for frontend-backend API integration scenarios**, **so that we can ensure reliable data flow, error handling, and authentication between the UI and backend services under real-world conditions**.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Frontend-Backend Integration Testing**: Comprehensive testing of UI-API communication
   - URL analysis form submission to `/api/analyze` endpoint with real backend responses
   - Loading states properly reflect actual API processing time
   - Results display correctly renders real analysis data from backend
   - Form validation integrates properly with backend validation responses

2. **API Endpoint Validation Through UI**: Testing API contracts via user interface
   - Valid URL submissions return properly formatted AnalysisResponse objects
   - Invalid URL submissions trigger appropriate error responses (400 status)
   - API request/response format matches OpenAPI specification
   - Request correlation IDs properly tracked across frontend-backend boundary

3. **Error Handling Scenarios**: Robust error scenario testing
   - API failure responses (500, 503 errors) handled gracefully with user-friendly messages
   - Network timeout scenarios show appropriate loading states and recovery options
   - Rate limiting (429 errors) triggers proper retry mechanisms and user feedback
   - Partial service degradation displays available results with degradation warnings

4. **Data Flow Validation**: Request/response integrity verification
   - Submitted URLs properly encoded and transmitted to backend
   - Analysis results display matches actual backend response data
   - Risk score calculations from backend properly reflected in UI gauge
   - Technical details sections populated with real analysis data

5. **Authentication and Authorization Flows**: Security integration testing
   - API requests include proper authentication headers when required
   - Unauthorized requests (401) handled with appropriate user prompts
   - Session management works correctly across analysis workflows
   - Rate limiting per user/session properly enforced and communicated

6. **Performance Under Load**: API scenario performance validation
   - Multiple concurrent analysis requests handled properly by UI
   - Long-running analysis operations maintain responsive UI with progress indicators
   - Backend timeout scenarios handled without breaking user experience
   - API response caching works correctly to improve performance

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
From Stories 3.14 and 3.15, key learnings for API scenarios testing:
- Playwright E2E framework already configured with version 1.55.0 [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#e2e-testing]
- Cross-browser testing patterns established for consistent API behavior
- User flow testing foundation provides integration patterns for API scenario tests

### API Specifications
**Primary Integration Endpoint**: `/api/analyze` POST endpoint for URL analysis [Source: architecture/api-specification.md#paths]
- Request format: `{ url: string, includeDetails?: boolean }`
- Response format: AnalysisResponse with requestId, overallScore, riskLevel, recommendations
- Error responses: 400 (invalid request), 429 (rate limit), 500 (server error)
- Authentication: Future integration with AWS Cognito JWT tokens [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#authentication]

**Health Check Endpoint**: `/api/health` GET endpoint for service availability testing
- Used for testing external service connectivity and degradation scenarios

### Data Models
**AnalysisResponse TypeScript Interface** [Source: architecture/data-models.md#analysisresult]:
```typescript
interface AnalysisResponse {
  requestId: string;
  url: string;
  overallScore: number; // 0-100
  riskLevel: 'GREEN' | 'YELLOW' | 'RED';
  recommendations: string[];
  analysis: {
    domain: DomainAnalysis;
    reputation: ReputationAnalysis;
    content: ContentAnalysis;
  };
}
```

**Error Response Format** [Source: architecture/error-handling-strategy.md#error-response-format]:
```typescript
interface ApiError {
  error: {
    code: string;
    message: string;
    details?: Record<string, any>;
    timestamp: string;
    requestId: string;
    degraded?: boolean;
    failedServices?: string[];
  };
}
```

### Component Specifications

### Testing Requirements
**E2E Testing Framework**: Playwright 1.55.0 with cross-browser support [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#e2e-testing]
- Test execution: Chrome, Firefox, Safari browsers
- Mobile device emulation for responsive API testing
- Network condition simulation for timeout/slow connection testing

**Test Coverage Requirements**: 
- Focus on integration correctness over comprehensive business logic [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#e2e-service-test-configuration]
- Rate limiting awareness with delays and API quota respect
- Graceful failure with clear error messages when services unavailable
- CI/CD integration required to pass before production deployment

### Technical Constraints
**API Client Service Layer**: Never make direct HTTP calls from components [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#critical-fullstack-rules]
- All API calls through `src/lib/api-client` service layer
- Type validation using shared TypeScript interfaces
- Error handling through standard error middleware

**Environment Configuration**: Test environment with real API endpoints
- Use test API keys and safe test domains for external service integration
- Environment-specific configuration through config objects, not direct process.env access

**Performance Targets**: 
- API Response: Complete analysis < 3 seconds average [Source: epic-03-user-interface-experience.md#success-metrics]
- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1
- Bundle size within performance budget (< 200KB)

### Testing

**Test File Locations** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-organization]:
- E2E API tests: `tests/e2e/api-scenarios/`
- File naming: `*.e2e.test.ts` for all E2E test files
- Separate test suite execution: `npm run test:e2e:api-scenarios`

**Testing Framework Requirements** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#test-types-and-locations]:
- Playwright E2E testing with real API endpoints
- Mock external services for unit/integration tests, real endpoints for E2E
- Coverage target: 80% minimum across all test types
- CI/CD integration with browser testing pipeline

**API Integration Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/testing-strategy.md#external-service-integration-testing-strategy]:
- Test service integration wiring correctness
- Verify authentication and network connectivity
- Validate request/response format compatibility
- Basic functionality verification without comprehensive edge case testing
