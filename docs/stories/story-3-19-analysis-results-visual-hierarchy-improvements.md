# Story 3-19: Analysis Results Visual Hierarchy Improvements

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** user,  
**I want** the Analysis Results section to have proper visual hierarchy where "Analysis Results" is the most prominent heading, followed by the domain name, then "URL Security Report", with Key Findings positioned as a subordinate element within Technical Analysis,  
**so that** I can easily understand the information architecture and navigate through results in a logical, scannable order without visual hierarchy confusion.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Analysis Results Primary Heading**: Update "Analysis Results" to H1 styling with largest font size and visual weight to establish it as the primary section heading
2. **Domain Name Visual Prominence**: Ensure domain header uses H2 styling, making it more prominent than "URL Security Report" but subordinate to "Analysis Results"
3. **URL Security Report Secondary**: Update "URL Security Report" to H3 styling, smaller than domain name but maintaining clear section identification
4. **Key Findings Repositioning**: Move Key Findings component inside Technical Analysis section as the first expandable item with reduced visual prominence
5. **Key Findings Visual Hierarchy**: Redesign Key Findings with subdued styling - lighter borders, smaller typography, reduced padding for less visual dominance
6. **Technical Analysis Section Structure**: Implement Technical Analysis as H3 section container that houses Key Findings and all other technical detail accordions
7. **Responsive Typography Compliance**: Ensure all heading changes maintain responsive typography as defined in front-end specification
8. **Accessibility Preservation**: Maintain proper heading hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3) and ARIA labeling for screen readers

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Based on Story 3-18 completion, the unified Analysis Results view has been successfully implemented with all components in place. However, UX evaluation using Playwright testing against localhost:3000 with "https://wikipedia.com" revealed critical visual hierarchy issues that need correction to improve user experience and information architecture.

### Front-End Specification Updates (v1.2)

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#analysis-results-panel]
Recent comprehensive UX evaluation identified and documented specific visual hierarchy corrections:

**Current Visual Hierarchy Issues:**

- "URL Security Report" (H3) currently appears larger than domain name (H2)
- "Analysis Results" lacks proper H1 prominence as primary section heading
- Key Findings positioned as prominent standalone section instead of technical detail
- Visual weight distribution creates confusing information architecture

**Required Visual Hierarchy Structure:**

- **Analysis Results** (H1): Primary section heading with maximum visual weight (`text-4xl font-bold`)
- **Domain Name** (H2): Prominently displayed extracted domain name (`text-3xl font-semibold`)
- **URL Security Report** (H3): Secondary section identifier (`text-2xl font-semibold`)
- **Technical Analysis** (H3): Container for detailed technical information
  - **Key Findings**: Subdued summary component (moved inside Technical Analysis)
  - **Domain Information**: Expandable accordion section
  - **SSL Certificate**: Expandable accordion section
  - **Reputation Analysis**: Expandable accordion section
  - **AI Content Analysis**: Expandable accordion section

### Component Structure Updates Required

[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#component-architecture + docs/front-end-spec.md v1.2]

**ResultsDisplay Component** (src/components/analysis/results-display.tsx):

- Currently renders unified results with correct components but incorrect hierarchy
- Needs heading structure updates: H1 for Analysis Results, maintain H2 for domain, H3 for URL Security Report
- Requires Technical Analysis section restructuring as parent container

**Key Findings Component** (src/components/analysis/key-findings.tsx):

- Currently positioned as prominent standalone section with colored borders and padding
- Needs redesign: reduce visual prominence, integrate into Technical Analysis section
- Move from standalone component to first accordion item within Technical Analysis

**Technical Details Component** (src/components/analysis/technical-details.tsx):

- Currently contains accordion sections for technical information
- Needs restructuring: Technical Analysis as parent H3 section containing Key Findings + existing accordions
- Maintain existing accordion functionality while adding Key Findings as first expandable item

### Typography System Implementation

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#typography]

**Updated Heading Hierarchy:**

```typescript
// Analysis Results - Primary Section Heading (H1)
className = "text-4xl font-bold leading-tight"; // Desktop
className = "text-3xl font-bold leading-tight"; // Tablet
className = "text-2xl font-bold leading-tight"; // Mobile

// Domain Name - Extracted Domain Header (H2)
className = "text-3xl font-semibold leading-tight"; // Desktop
className = "text-2xl font-semibold leading-tight"; // Tablet
className = "text-lg font-semibold leading-tight"; // Mobile

// URL Security Report & Technical Analysis - Section Headers (H3)
className = "text-2xl font-semibold leading-snug"; // Desktop
className = "text-xl font-semibold leading-snug"; // Tablet
className = "text-lg font-semibold leading-snug"; // Mobile
```

### Key Findings Component Redesign Specifications

[Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#key-findings-component-redesign]

**Visual Prominence Reduction:**

- **Border Styling**: Replace colored borders (`border-emerald-200`, `border-orange-200`, `border-red-200`) with neutral `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700`
- **Padding Reduction**: Change from `p-3` (12px) to `p-2` (8px) for more compact appearance
- **Typography Downgrade**:
  - Finding titles: From `text-sm font-medium` to `text-xs font-normal`
  - Maintain badge text readability while reducing visual weight
- **Background Opacity**: Reduce from 50% to 25% for more subdued appearance (`bg-emerald-50/25`, `bg-orange-50/25`, `bg-red-50/25`)
- **Integration Method**: Convert from standalone section to accordion item within Technical Analysis

### Technical Architecture Context

[Source: docs/architecture/frontend-architecture.md#state-management-architecture]

**State Management Changes NOT Required:**

- Analysis state structure remains unchanged
- No modifications needed to `viewMode`, `expandedSections`, or `toggleSection` functionality
- Key Findings integration uses existing accordion state patterns

**Component Integration Requirements:**

- Key Findings maintains existing data structure and props
- Technical Analysis becomes parent container using existing accordion patterns
- No breaking changes to component APIs or data flow

### File Locations and Structure

[Source: docs/architecture/unified-project-structure.md]

**Files to Modify:**

- `src/components/analysis/results-display.tsx` - Update heading hierarchy structure
- `src/components/analysis/key-findings.tsx` - Redesign visual styling for reduced prominence
- `src/components/analysis/technical-details.tsx` - Restructure as Technical Analysis section container

**Potential New Files:**

- If needed: `src/components/analysis/technical-analysis-section.tsx` - New parent container component

### shadcn/ui Component Usage

[Source: docs/architecture/components.md + docs/front-end-spec.md]

**Typography Components:**

- Use existing Tailwind typography utilities for heading hierarchy updates
- No new shadcn components required for heading changes

**Accordion Integration:**

- Use existing `Accordion`, `AccordionContent`, `AccordionItem`, `AccordionTrigger` for Key Findings integration
- Maintain consistent styling with other technical detail sections

**Visual Styling:**

- Use existing `border-gray-200 dark:border-gray-700` classes for neutral borders
- Apply existing background opacity utilities: `bg-gray-50/25 dark:bg-gray-800/25`

### Technical Constraints

[Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]
