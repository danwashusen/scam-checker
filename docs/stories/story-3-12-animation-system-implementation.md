# Story 3-12: Animation System Implementation

## Status
Draft

## User Story

**As a** user interacting with the analysis results,
**I want** smooth, professional animations throughout the interface that enhance the experience without being distracting,
**so that** the application feels polished and provides clear visual feedback during state transitions.

1. **Results Panel Entrance Animations**: Smooth reveal of analysis results
   - Fade-in animation for entire results panel (0.6s duration)
   - Slide-up motion from bottom with subtle bounce easing
   - Stagger animation for key findings list items (0.1s delay between items)
   - Scale-in animation for action buttons after results display

2. **View Transition Animations**: Smooth switching between Simple and Technical views
   - Cross-fade transition between view content (0.4s duration)
   - Preserve scroll position during view switches
   - Tab indicator sliding animation for active tab highlight
   - Content height auto-adjustment with smooth transition

3. **Loading State Animations**: Professional loading indicators
   - Spinner animation with smooth rotation (1s duration, infinite)
   - Skeleton loading animations for content placeholders
   - Progress indication for analysis steps
   - Pulsing animation for loading states

4. **Interactive Element Animations**: Responsive feedback for user actions
   - Hover animations for buttons (scale: 1.05, 0.2s duration)
   - Click/tap feedback with brief scale-down effect
   - Focus ring animations for accessibility
   - Smooth color transitions for state changes (0.3s duration)

5. **Error State Animations**: Clear visual feedback for errors
   - Shake animation for invalid URL input (0.5s duration)
   - Attention-drawing pulse for error messages
   - Smooth slide-in for error banners
   - Fade-out animations for dismissible alerts

6. **Responsive Animation Performance**: Optimized animations across devices
   - Reduced animations on mobile devices for performance
   - Respect user's reduced motion preferences
   - 60fps target for all animations
   - Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks

## Dev Notes

### Critical Context
The design review identified missing animations throughout the application. Modern users expect smooth, professional animations that provide visual feedback and enhance the overall experience. This is particularly important for a security tool where trust and polish are essential.

### Current State vs Required
- **Current**: Basic state transitions with no animations
- **Required**: Comprehensive animation system with smooth transitions, loading states, and interactive feedback
- **Gap**: No animation framework, missing motion design, lack of loading state animations

### Animation Framework Selection
**Framer Motion** is recommended for this implementation:
- React-first animation library with excellent performance
- Declarative API that matches React patterns  
- Built-in gesture support and layout animations
- Excellent TypeScript support
- Small bundle size and good tree-shaking

### Animation Design Principles
1. **Purpose**: Every animation should have a clear purpose (feedback, transition, attention)
2. **Performance**: Target 60fps on all devices, graceful degradation
3. **Accessibility**: Respect reduced motion preferences, provide alternatives
4. **Timing**: Natural timing that feels responsive but not rushed
5. **Easing**: Use appropriate easing curves (ease-out for entrances, ease-in for exits)

### Key Animation Patterns to Implement
```typescript
// Entrance animations
const fadeIn = {
  initial: { opacity: 0 },
  animate: { opacity: 1 },
  transition: { duration: 0.6 }
}

// Slide animations  
const slideUp = {
  initial: { y: 20, opacity: 0 },
  animate: { y: 0, opacity: 1 },
  transition: { duration: 0.6, ease: "easeOut" }
}

// Stagger animations
const staggerContainer = {
  animate: {
    transition: {
      staggerChildren: 0.1
    }
  }
}
```

### Relevant Source Tree
- **Results components**: `src/components/analysis/` - All components need entrance animations
- **View transitions**: Tab switching between Simple/Technical views
- **Loading states**: Spinner, skeleton, progress components
- **Interactive elements**: Buttons, form inputs, links throughout app
- **Error handling**: Form validation, API error displays

### Animation Performance Requirements
- **Frame rate**: 60fps target on modern devices, graceful degradation
- **Memory**: Proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
- **Bundle size**: Tree-shake unused animations, lazy load complex animations
- **Reduced motion**: Provide alternatives for accessibility preferences

### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: `tests/unit/components/animations/`
- **Test frameworks**: Jest + React Testing Library + Framer Motion testing utils
- **Required tests**: Animation timing, reduced motion handling, performance tests
- **Visual regression**: Animation screenshots at key frames
- **Performance tests**: Frame rate monitoring, memory usage tracking
- **Accessibility tests**: Reduced motion preference handling

### Integration Requirements
- Must integrate with existing shadcn/ui components
- Compatible with Next.js App Router and SSR
- Maintains TypeScript strict mode compatibility
- Integrates with existing loading states and error handling
- Works with responsive design system
