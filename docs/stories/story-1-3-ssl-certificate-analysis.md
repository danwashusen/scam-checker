# Story 1-3: SSL Certificate Analysis

## User Story

As a **security analysis system**,
I want **to assess SSL certificate quality and security properties**,
So that **I can identify potential security risks and certificate-based scam indicators**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Story 1-1 URL parsing system
- Technology: SSL Labs API or custom certificate analysis
- Follows pattern: External security API integration
- Touch points: Risk scoring system, security assessment pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **SSL Certificate Retrieval**: System retrieves and analyzes SSL certificates
   - Certificate chain validation and completeness
   - Certificate authority (CA) identification and reputation
   - Certificate validity period and expiration status
   - Certificate type identification (DV, OV, EV)

2. **Security Assessment**: System evaluates certificate security properties
   - Encryption strength analysis (key size, algorithm)
   - Cipher suite evaluation and security ratings
   - Certificate transparency log verification
   - Certificate revocation status checking

3. **Risk Indicator Detection**: System identifies certificate-based risk factors
   - Self-signed certificates flagged as high risk
   - Recently issued certificates (< 30 days) flagged for review
   - Weak encryption or outdated protocols identified
   - Certificate mismatch with domain ownership patterns

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Accepts domain information from URL parsing system
5. Provides SSL security score to overall risk assessment
6. Caches certificate analysis results with 12-hour TTL
7. Handles SSL connection failures and missing certificates gracefully

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Certificate analysis completes within 3 seconds for most domains
9. System handles various certificate configurations and edge cases
10. SSL connection respects timeouts to prevent hanging requests
11. Detailed logging for certificate analysis and security scoring

## Technical Notes

- **Primary Method**: SSL Labs API for comprehensive analysis
- **Fallback Method**: Direct certificate inspection using Node.js TLS/crypto
- **Security Focus**: Emphasize certificate authority reputation and validity
- **Performance**: Implement connection pooling and timeout management
- **Data Retention**: Cache certificate analysis to avoid repeated expensive checks

## Definition of Done

- [ ] SSL certificate retrieval and validation implemented
- [ ] Security assessment covers all specified properties
- [ ] Risk indicator detection identifies suspicious certificates
- [ ] Certificate analysis integrates with overall risk scoring
- [ ] Caching system reduces repeated certificate checks
- [ ] Error handling manages SSL failures gracefully
- [ ] Unit tests cover certificate analysis logic
- [ ] Integration tests validate SSL Labs API usage
- [ ] Performance meets response time requirements
- [ ] Security assessment methodology documented

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: SSL Labs API rate limits affecting certificate analysis
- **Mitigation**: Implement local certificate inspection as fallback method
- **Rollback**: System can operate without detailed SSL analysis using basic HTTPS check

## Testing Requirements

- Test with various certificate types (DV, OV, EV, self-signed)
- Test with expired and revoked certificates
- Test with domains using different CAs
- Test with weak encryption and modern strong encryption
- Test SSL connection failures and timeouts
- Test certificate chain validation edge cases
- Performance testing under concurrent SSL checks
- Security testing for SSL connection handling

## Certificate Analysis Scoring

**High Risk (70-100):**
- Self-signed certificates
- Expired or soon-to-expire certificates
- Weak encryption (< 2048-bit keys)
- Untrusted certificate authorities

**Medium Risk (30-69):**
- Recently issued certificates (< 30 days)
- Domain validation (DV) certificates only
- Older encryption standards
- Certificate transparency log absence

**Low Risk (0-29):**
- Extended validation (EV) certificates
- Long-standing certificates from trusted CAs
- Strong modern encryption
- Complete certificate chain validation
