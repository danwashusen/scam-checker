# Story 1-3: SSL Certificate Analysis

## User Story

As a **security analysis system**,
I want **to assess SSL certificate quality and security properties**,
So that **I can identify potential security risks and certificate-based scam indicators**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Story 1-1 URL parsing system
- Technology: Node.js TLS/crypto module for direct certificate analysis
- Follows pattern: Native system certificate inspection
- Touch points: Risk scoring system, security assessment pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **SSL Certificate Retrieval**: System retrieves and analyzes SSL certificates
   - Certificate chain validation and completeness
   - Certificate authority (CA) identification and reputation
   - Certificate validity period and expiration status
   - Certificate type identification (DV, OV, EV)

2. **Security Assessment**: System evaluates certificate security properties
   - Encryption strength analysis (key size, algorithm)
   - Certificate signature algorithm evaluation
   - Basic certificate validation and trust chain verification
   - Certificate revocation status checking (OCSP when available)

3. **Risk Indicator Detection**: System identifies certificate-based risk factors
   - Self-signed certificates flagged as high risk
   - Recently issued certificates (< 30 days) flagged for review
   - Weak encryption algorithms or small key sizes identified
   - Subject Alternative Name (SAN) mismatch with requested domain

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Accepts domain information from URL parsing system
5. Provides SSL security score to overall risk assessment
6. Caches certificate analysis results with 6-hour TTL (faster refresh for simpler analysis)
7. Handles SSL connection failures and missing certificates gracefully

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Certificate analysis completes within 2 seconds for most domains (faster with direct inspection)
9. System handles various certificate configurations and edge cases
10. SSL connection respects 5-second timeouts to prevent hanging requests
11. Detailed logging for certificate analysis and security scoring

## Technical Notes

- **Primary Method**: Direct certificate inspection using Node.js TLS/crypto module
- **Implementation**: Use `tls.connect()` and certificate parsing with node's built-in crypto
- **Security Focus**: Certificate validity, trust chain, and basic security properties
- **Performance**: Direct connection is faster than external API calls
- **Data Retention**: Cache certificate analysis to avoid repeated connection overhead

## Definition of Done

- [x] SSL certificate retrieval and validation implemented
- [x] Security assessment covers all specified properties
- [x] Risk indicator detection identifies suspicious certificates
- [x] Certificate analysis integrates with overall risk scoring
- [x] Caching system reduces repeated certificate checks
- [x] Error handling manages SSL failures gracefully
- [x] Unit tests cover certificate analysis logic
- [x] Integration tests validate direct certificate inspection
- [x] Performance meets response time requirements (< 2 seconds)
- [x] Security assessment methodology documented

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Network timeouts or SSL connection failures affecting analysis
- **Mitigation**: Implement robust timeout handling and connection retry logic
- **Rollback**: System can operate without detailed SSL analysis using basic HTTPS check

## Testing Requirements

- Test with various certificate types (DV, OV, EV, self-signed)
- Test with expired and revoked certificates
- Test with domains using different CAs
- Test with weak encryption algorithms and modern strong encryption
- Test SSL connection failures and timeouts
- Test certificate chain validation and trust verification
- Performance testing under concurrent certificate inspections
- Security testing for direct SSL connection handling

## Certificate Analysis Scoring

**High Risk (70-100):**
- Self-signed certificates
- Expired or soon-to-expire certificates
- Weak encryption (< 2048-bit keys)
- Untrusted certificate authorities

**Medium Risk (30-69):**
- Recently issued certificates (< 30 days)
- Domain validation (DV) certificates only
- Older signature algorithms (SHA-1, MD5)
- Certificate chain validation issues

**Low Risk (0-29):**
- Extended validation (EV) certificates
- Long-standing certificates from trusted CAs
- Strong modern encryption
- Complete certificate chain validation
