## Dev Notes

### Critical Context
The design review found that while the mobile layout is functional, it lacks the polish and optimization expected for a security tool that users might frequently access on mobile devices. Mobile optimization is crucial for user trust and accessibility.

### Current State vs Required
- **Current**: Responsive layout with basic mobile support
- **Required**: Comprehensive mobile-first experience with touch optimization, gestures, and performance tuning
- **Gap**: Missing touch target optimization, mobile-specific sizing, gesture support, and performance optimization

### Mobile-First Design Principles
1. **Touch-First**: Design for fingers, not cursors
2. **Thumb-Friendly**: Place key actions within natural thumb reach
3. **Performance**: Mobile networks and devices are typically slower
4. **Context**: Mobile users are often in hurried, distracted situations
5. **Accessibility**: Mobile accessibility is often more challenging

### Thumb Reach Zones (One-Handed Use)
```
Screen Areas by Thumb Reachability:
- Easy reach: Bottom third of screen
- Medium reach: Middle third (comfortable with adjustment)
- Hard reach: Top third (requires two hands or phone adjustment)

Primary actions should be in easy reach zone.
```

### Mobile Component Specifications
- **Risk Gauge**: 120px diameter (vs 200px desktop)
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44x44px (WCAG AAA standard)
- **Button Heights**: 48px minimum for comfortable touch
- **Input Heights**: 48px for easy tapping and typing
- **Spacing**: Minimum 8px between touch targets

### Gesture Implementation
- **Swipe Navigation**: Implement using touch events and CSS transforms
- **Pull-to-Refresh**: Custom implementation or use established library
- **Long-Press**: Use pointer events for cross-platform compatibility
- **Scroll Momentum**: Use CSS scroll-behavior and -webkit-overflow-scrolling

### Relevant Source Tree
- **Mobile breakpoints**: Tailwind CSS configuration and responsive utilities
- **Components**: All components in `src/components/` need mobile optimization
- **Touch handling**: May need to add gesture utility functions
- **Performance**: Bundle optimization and lazy loading configurations

### Mobile Performance Targets
- **First Contentful Paint**: <2s on slow 3G
- **Time to Interactive**: <5s on slow 3G
- **Bundle Size**: <200KB initial bundle for mobile
- **Memory Usage**: <50MB peak memory usage
- **Frame Rate**: 60fps for animations, 30fps minimum acceptable

### Testing Requirements
**Device Testing Matrix:**
- **iOS**: iPhone SE, iPhone 14/15 (various sizes)
- **Android**: Samsung Galaxy (mid-range), Pixel devices
- **Screen sizes**: 320px to 428px width range
- **Network**: Fast 3G, Slow 3G, offline scenarios

### Testing Standards
- **Test file location**: `tests/mobile/` and `tests/integration/mobile/`
- **Test frameworks**: Playwright for mobile testing, Jest for unit tests
- **Required tests**: Touch interactions, gesture support, responsive sizing
- **Performance tests**: Mobile performance metrics and device testing
- **Accessibility tests**: Mobile screen reader compatibility

### Integration Requirements
- Must maintain existing desktop functionality
- Compatible with all existing components and views
- Integrates with animation system (Story 3-12)
- Works with updated risk gauge (Story 3-11)
- Supports corrected scoring logic (Stories 3-9, 3-10)
