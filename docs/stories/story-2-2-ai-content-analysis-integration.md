   - Domain reputation lookup integration
   - URL pattern analysis (suspicious TLDs, homographs, typosquatting)
   - Context gathering from previous analysis stages

2. **AI URL Risk Assessment**: Leverage AI for URL-based scam detection
   - Develop and optimize structured prompts for URL pattern analysis
   - Domain reputation and trustworthiness assessment
   - Scam URL pattern recognition (fake domains, suspicious paths)
   - Phishing URL identification (brand impersonation, homograph attacks)
   - AI prompt versioning and A/B testing for accuracy optimization

3. **Structured Risk Response**: Generate AI-based URL risk assessment
   - URL risk score (0-100) based on AI analysis
   - Confidence level for AI assessment quality
   - Specific risk factors and pattern matches identified
   - Scam category classification (financial, phishing, e-commerce, etc.)
   - Structured JSON response for integration

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Receives URLs and context from previous analysis stages
5. Provides structured risk assessment to overall scoring algorithm
6. Handles AI API failures with graceful degradation
7. Respects AI API rate limits and cost management

**Quality Requirements:**

8. URL analysis completes within 2 seconds for most requests
9. AI prompt engineering developed, tested, and optimized for URL risk assessment accuracy
10. Cost management prevents excessive AI API usage
11. Analysis logging enables pattern improvement and model refinement

## Technical Notes
