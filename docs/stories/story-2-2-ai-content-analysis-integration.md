# Story 2-2: AI Content Analysis Integration

## User Story

As a **content-aware threat detector**,
I want **AI-powered analysis of webpage content to identify scam patterns and deceptive practices**,
So that **I can detect sophisticated scams that bypass traditional technical indicators**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Multi-factor scoring algorithm from Story 2-1
- Technology: OpenAI/Claude API for content analysis, web scraping
- Follows pattern: AI API integration with structured prompts
- Touch points: Risk scoring system, explanation generation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Web Content Retrieval**: System fetches and processes webpage content
   - HTTP/HTTPS content fetching with user-agent spoofing
   - HTML parsing and text extraction (title, headings, body content)
   - Image and media content analysis (alt text, suspicious patterns)
   - JavaScript-rendered content handling where possible

2. **AI Scam Pattern Detection**: Leverage AI for content analysis
   - Structured prompts for scam pattern identification
   - Analysis of language patterns (urgency, fear tactics, too-good-to-be-true)
   - Financial scam detection (fake investments, cryptocurrency schemes)
   - Phishing attempt identification (credential harvesting, impersonation)

3. **Content Risk Scoring**: Generate AI-based content risk assessment
   - Content risk score (0-100) based on AI analysis
   - Confidence level for AI assessment quality
   - Specific scam indicators and pattern matches identified
   - Language and localization considerations for accuracy

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Receives URLs from previous analysis stages
5. Provides content risk score to overall scoring algorithm
6. Handles content retrieval failures and inaccessible pages
7. Respects AI API rate limits and cost management

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Content analysis completes within 5 seconds for most pages
9. AI prompt engineering optimized for scam detection accuracy
10. Cost management prevents excessive AI API usage
11. Content analysis logging enables pattern improvement

## Technical Notes

- **AI Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4 or Claude API for content analysis
- **Web Scraping**: Puppeteer for JavaScript-heavy sites, fetch for simple HTML
- **Prompt Engineering**: Specialized prompts for different scam types
- **Cost Control**: Request batching and smart caching to minimize API calls
- **Content Processing**: Text extraction, normalization, and length management

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Web content retrieval handles various website types and technologies
- [ ] AI integration detects common scam patterns with high accuracy
- [ ] Content risk scoring provides meaningful input to overall algorithm
- [ ] Integration with multi-factor scoring system completed
- [ ] Cost management keeps AI API usage within budget constraints
- [ ] Error handling manages content retrieval and AI API failures
- [ ] Unit tests cover content analysis logic and edge cases
- [ ] Integration tests validate AI API interactions and responses
- [ ] Prompt engineering documentation enables future improvements
- [ ] Performance meets response time requirements under load

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: High AI API costs from excessive content analysis requests
- **Mitigation**: Smart caching, content size limits, and cost monitoring with circuit breakers
- **Rollback**: System operates without AI content analysis using only technical indicators

## Testing Requirements

- Test with known scam website content (phishing, fake stores, investment scams)
- Test with legitimate website content to avoid false positives
- Test with various content types (HTML, JavaScript-heavy, mobile sites)
- Test content retrieval failures and inaccessible pages
- Test AI API error scenarios and fallback behavior
- Test cost management and rate limiting functionality
- Performance testing for content analysis speed
- Validation testing against manually labeled scam content

## AI Analysis Framework

**Scam Pattern Categories:**

1. **Financial Scams:**
   - Investment schemes with unrealistic returns
   - Cryptocurrency scams and fake exchanges
   - Loan/credit scams with upfront fees
   - Insurance and financial service impersonation

2. **Phishing Attempts:**
   - Banking and payment service impersonation
   - Social media and email service fake logins
   - Government agency impersonation
   - Tech support and software company impersonation

3. **E-commerce Fraud:**
   - Fake online stores with stolen product images
   - Unrealistic pricing and deals
   - Missing contact information and policies
   - Poor grammar and unprofessional presentation

4. **Social Engineering:**
   - Urgency and fear-based language
   - Authority impersonation
   - False scarcity and time pressure
   - Emotional manipulation tactics

## Content Analysis Prompt Structure

```
Analyze the following webpage content for scam indicators:

Title: {page_title}
Main Content: {extracted_text}
URL Context: {domain_info}
