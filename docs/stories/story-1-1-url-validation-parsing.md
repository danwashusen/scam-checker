# Story 1-1: URL Validation & Parsing System

## User Story

As a **system developer**,
I want **robust URL validation and parsing capabilities**,
So that **the application can reliably process user-submitted URLs and extract necessary components for analysis**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: New Next.js application foundation
- Technology: Next.js API routes, TypeScript
- Follows pattern: Standard validation and sanitization patterns
- Touch points: Frontend form submission, API endpoint processing

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **URL Validation**: System validates URLs using comprehensive regex and URI parsing
   - Accepts HTTP and HTTPS protocols
   - Rejects malformed URLs with clear error messages
   - Handles edge cases like internationalized domain names (IDN)
   - Validates domain format and length constraints

2. **URL Parsing**: System extracts components from valid URLs
   - Protocol (http/https)
   - Domain/hostname
   - Port (if specified)
   - Path, query parameters, and fragments
   - Subdomain identification

3. **URL Sanitization**: System cleans and normalizes URLs
   - Removes tracking parameters
   - Normalizes protocol (upgrade http to https where appropriate)
   - Handles URL encoding/decoding
   - Removes unnecessary fragments for analysis

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Frontend form accepts URL input with real-time validation feedback
5. API endpoint receives and validates URLs before processing
6. Error handling provides specific feedback for different validation failures

**Quality Requirements:**

7. Input validation prevents XSS and injection attacks
8. Unit tests cover all validation scenarios and edge cases
9. Performance handles 1000+ URLs per minute validation
10. Logging captures validation failures for monitoring

## Technical Notes

- **Implementation Approach**: Use Node.js URL constructor with additional validation layers
- **Security Considerations**: Sanitize all inputs, prevent SSRF attacks
- **Performance**: Cache validation results for repeated URLs
- **Error Handling**: Structured error responses with specific failure reasons

## Definition of Done

- [ ] URL validation function handles all specified URL types and edge cases
- [ ] URL parsing extracts all required components accurately
- [ ] URL sanitization removes tracking and normalizes format
- [ ] Frontend integration provides real-time validation feedback
- [ ] API endpoint validates URLs before processing
- [ ] Security audit passed for input validation
- [ ] Unit tests achieve 95%+ coverage
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet requirements
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly and actionable
- [ ] Documentation includes validation rules and examples

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Complex URL edge cases causing validation failures
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive test suite with real-world URL examples
- **Rollback**: Simple fallback validation using basic regex patterns

## Testing Requirements

- Test with various URL formats and protocols
- Test with malformed and malicious URLs
- Test with international domain names
- Test with very long URLs and edge cases
- Performance testing under load
- Security testing for injection vulnerabilities
