# Story 3-1: URL Input & Validation Interface

## User Story

As a **website user**,
I want **a clean, intuitive URL input form with immediate validation feedback**,
So that **I can easily submit URLs for analysis and understand any input issues before analysis begins**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Story 1-1 URL validation system
- Technology: Next.js, React, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS
- Follows pattern: Modern form design with real-time validation
- Touch points: URL validation logic, analysis pipeline, loading states

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **URL Input Form**: Create clean, accessible URL input interface
   - Large, prominent input field with clear labeling
   - Placeholder text with example URL format
   - Submit button with clear call-to-action text
   - Mobile-responsive design with touch-friendly sizing

2. **Real-Time Validation**: Provide immediate feedback on URL input
   - Live validation as user types (with debouncing)
   - Visual indicators for valid/invalid URLs (green/red border colors)
   - Specific error messages for different validation failures
   - Success state indication when URL passes validation

3. **User Experience Enhancements**: Optimize input experience for usability
   - Auto-focus on URL input field on page load
   - URL auto-correction (add https:// if missing protocol)
   - Paste detection and automatic validation
   - Clear/reset functionality to quickly start over

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Uses URL validation logic from Story 1-1
5. Triggers analysis pipeline on successful form submission
6. Integrates with loading states during analysis
7. Handles validation errors gracefully with user-friendly messaging

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Form validation response time under 100ms for user feedback
9. Input field handles URLs up to 2048 characters
10. Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA) with keyboard navigation
11. Mobile interface optimized for thumb typing and visibility

## Technical Notes

- **Components**: shadcn/ui form components with custom validation styling
- **Validation**: Client-side validation using Story 1-1 validation logic
- **State Management**: React state for input value and validation status
- **Performance**: Debounced validation to avoid excessive validation calls
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and error announcements

## Definition of Done

- [ ] URL input form implemented with clean, professional design
- [ ] Real-time validation provides immediate user feedback
