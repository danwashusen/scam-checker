# Story 5-1: AWS Serverless Architecture Setup

## User Story

As a **platform engineer**,
I want **to deploy the Next.js scam checker application on AWS using serverless architecture**,
So that **the application scales automatically, has minimal operational overhead, and provides global performance**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Complete Next.js scam checker application
- Technology: AWS Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront, S3
- Follows pattern: Serverless-first architecture with managed services
- Touch points: All application components, external APIs, static assets

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Next.js Lambda Deployment**: Deploy application using serverless Next.js
   - Configure Next.js for serverless deployment with standalone mode
   - Deploy API routes as individual Lambda functions
   - Implement proper cold start optimization
   - Configure Lambda memory and timeout settings for analysis workloads

2. **API Gateway Configuration**: Set up managed API gateway for routing
   - Configure API Gateway v2 (HTTP API) for cost efficiency
   - Implement proper CORS configuration for web client
   - Set up custom domain with SSL certificate
   - Configure request/response transformations as needed

3. **CloudFront CDN Setup**: Implement global content delivery network
   - Configure CloudFront distribution for static assets and API caching
   - Set up proper cache behaviors for different content types
   - Implement custom error pages and error handling
   - Configure geographic restrictions if needed

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Static assets (CSS, JS, images) served efficiently via S3 and CloudFront
5. API endpoints properly routed through API Gateway to Lambda functions
6. External API calls (WHOIS, VirusTotal, etc.) work from Lambda environment
7. Environment variables and secrets properly configured

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Application cold start time under 3 seconds for analysis requests
9. Static asset delivery optimized with appropriate caching headers
10. Lambda function monitoring and error tracking operational
11. Cost optimization through appropriate resource sizing

## Technical Notes

- **Deployment Method**: Serverless Framework, AWS CDK, or manual CloudFormation
- **Next.js Config**: Standalone build mode for Lambda compatibility
- **Lambda Settings**: 1GB memory, 30-second timeout for analysis functions
- **S3 Configuration**: Static website hosting for client-side assets
- **CloudFront**: Global edge locations for performance optimization

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Next.js application successfully deployed on AWS Lambda
- [ ] API Gateway properly routes requests to Lambda functions
- [ ] CloudFront CDN configured for optimal performance and caching
- [ ] Static assets served efficiently from S3 through CloudFront
- [ ] External API integrations functional from Lambda environment
- [ ] Environment variables and configuration properly managed
- [ ] Cold start performance meets sub-3-second requirements
- [ ] Basic monitoring and logging operational
- [ ] Cost optimization settings configured appropriately
- [ ] Documentation includes deployment and configuration procedures

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Lambda cold starts affecting user experience for analysis requests
- **Mitigation**: Provisioned concurrency for critical functions, keep-warm strategies
- **Rollback**: Maintain ability to deploy to traditional hosting if needed

## Testing Requirements

- Test complete application deployment from scratch
- Test all API endpoints through API Gateway
- Test static asset delivery through CloudFront
- Test external API calls from Lambda environment
- Test cold start performance and optimization
- Test scaling behavior under load
- Load testing for concurrent analysis requests

## AWS Architecture Components

**Core Services:**
- **AWS Lambda**: Next.js API routes and serverless functions
- **API Gateway**: HTTP API for cost-efficient request routing
- **CloudFront**: Global CDN for performance and caching
- **S3**: Static asset storage and hosting
- **Route 53**: DNS management and custom domain

**Configuration Details:**

**Lambda Functions:**
- Runtime: Node.js 18.x
- Memory: 1GB (adjustable based on analysis workload)
- Timeout: 30 seconds for analysis, 10 seconds for simple requests
- Environment: Node.js with all required dependencies

**API Gateway:**
- Type: HTTP API (v2) for cost optimization
- CORS: Configured for web application origin
- Throttling: Appropriate limits to prevent abuse
- Logging: Access logs enabled for monitoring

**CloudFront:**
- Origin: API Gateway and S3 bucket
- Cache Behaviors: Different policies for API vs. static content
- Compression: Gzip enabled for text content
- Security: Security headers and HTTPS redirect

## Performance Targets

- **Cold Start**: < 3 seconds for analysis requests
- **API Response**: < 2 seconds for cached results
- **Static Assets**: < 500ms global delivery time
- **Scaling**: Handle 100 concurrent users without degradation
- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime SLA

## Cost Optimization

- Lambda: Right-sized memory allocation
- API Gateway: HTTP API for lower costs than REST API
- CloudFront: Appropriate cache TTL settings
- S3: Intelligent tiering for cost efficiency
- Monitoring: Cost alerts and budget controls
