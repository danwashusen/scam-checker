# Story 3-14: User Flows E2E Testing

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a stakeholder**, **I want comprehensive E2E test coverage for complete user journeys**, **so that we can ensure the scam checker application works reliably for all user scenarios and interaction patterns**.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. **Complete User Journey Testing**: E2E tests cover the full workflow from URL input through analysis to results display with both simple and technical views
2. **Results Interaction Testing**: Tests verify switching between simple/technical views, expanding/collapsing sections, and all interactive elements function properly
3. **Error Scenario Coverage**: Comprehensive testing of invalid URL handling, API failure responses, network timeout scenarios, and partial service degradation
4. **Cross-Browser Validation**: Tests execute successfully across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari browsers with consistent behavior
5. **Performance Validation**: E2E tests verify Core Web Vitals targets (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1) are met during user flows
6. **Accessibility Validation**: Tests include keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility, and WCAG 2.1 AA compliance checks
7. **Mobile Experience Testing**: E2E tests cover mobile-responsive behavior including touch interactions and responsive layout validation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
The application has evolved through Epic 3 with completed foundation fixes (Story 3-1), backend integration (Story 3-2), dual-view results system (Story 3-3), and advanced UI states (Story 3-4). The E2E testing must validate the integration of all these components working together seamlessly.
