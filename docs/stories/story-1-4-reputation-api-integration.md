# Story 1-4: Reputation API Integration

## User Story

As a **threat intelligence system**,
I want **to integrate with multiple reputation APIs to gather security intelligence about URLs**,
So that **I can leverage community-driven threat data to identify known malicious domains and URLs**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Story 1-1 URL parsing system
- Technology: VirusTotal API, URLVoid API, and other reputation services
- Follows pattern: Multi-provider API integration with aggregation
- Touch points: Risk scoring system, threat intelligence pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **VirusTotal Integration**: System integrates with VirusTotal API v3
   - URL submission for analysis and historical data retrieval
   - Vendor scan result aggregation (antivirus engines)
   - Reputation score calculation based on detection ratios
   - URL categories and threat type identification

2. **URLVoid Integration**: System integrates with URLVoid API
   - Domain reputation checking across multiple engines
   - Blacklist status verification from various security vendors
   - Historical reputation data analysis
   - Aggregated reputation scoring

3. **Reputation Data Aggregation**: System combines data from multiple sources
   - Weighted scoring based on source reliability
   - Consensus determination from multiple reputation engines
   - Conflict resolution when sources disagree
   - Confidence scoring based on data agreement

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Accepts URLs from validation system for reputation checking
5. Provides aggregated reputation score to overall risk assessment
6. Caches reputation results with 6-hour TTL for efficiency
7. Handles API rate limits and quota management across providers

**Quality Requirements:**

8. API integration includes proper authentication and error handling
9. Response time under 4 seconds for aggregated reputation analysis
10. Data normalization handles different API response formats
11. Comprehensive logging for reputation data and scoring decisions

## Technical Notes

- **Primary APIs**: VirusTotal API v3, URLVoid API
- **Secondary Sources**: Consider Google Safe Browsing, PhishTank for additional coverage
- **Aggregation Strategy**: Weighted average with source reliability factors
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement request queuing to respect API limits
- **Data Processing**: Normalize detection ratios and threat categories

## Definition of Done

- [ ] VirusTotal API integration retrieves and processes scan results
- [ ] URLVoid API integration provides domain reputation data
- [ ] Reputation data aggregation combines multiple source scores
- [ ] Response caching implemented with appropriate TTL
- [ ] API rate limiting and quota management functional
- [ ] Error handling provides graceful degradation for each provider
- [ ] Unit tests cover reputation scoring logic
- [ ] Integration tests validate API interactions
- [ ] Performance meets response time requirements under load
- [ ] Documentation includes API configuration and scoring methodology

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Multiple API dependencies creating single points of failure
- **Mitigation**: Graceful degradation with partial reputation data, provider fallbacks
- **Rollback**: System can operate with reduced reputation coverage if APIs fail

## Testing Requirements

- Test with known malicious URLs and clean URLs
- Test with URLs having mixed reputation across providers
- Test API error scenarios and fallback behavior
- Test rate limiting and quota management
- Test data aggregation and conflict resolution
- Performance testing under concurrent requests
- Integration testing with actual reputation API providers

## Reputation Scoring Framework

**High Risk (70-100):**
- Multiple vendors flagging as malicious
- High detection ratio from antivirus engines
- Known malware or phishing campaigns
- Recent addition to blacklists

**Medium Risk (30-69):**
- Mixed vendor opinions
- Suspicious but not confirmed malicious
- Recently flagged by single vendor
- Historical reputation issues

**Low Risk (0-29):**
- Clean reputation across all vendors
- No historical security incidents
- Long-standing positive reputation
- Verified legitimate business domains

## Data Points to Collect

- VirusTotal: Detection ratio, vendor verdicts, threat types, last analysis date
- URLVoid: Blacklist status, reputation engines results, domain age cross-reference
- Aggregated: Overall reputation score, confidence level, threat categories
- Metadata: Data freshness, source reliability weights, conflict indicators
