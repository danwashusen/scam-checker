# Story 1-4: Reputation API Integration

## User Story

As a **threat intelligence system**,
I want **to integrate with Google Safe Browsing API to gather authoritative security intelligence about URLs**,
So that **I can leverage Google's comprehensive threat database to identify known malicious domains and URLs with high accuracy and reliability**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Story 1-1 URL parsing system
- Technology: Google Safe Browsing API v4
- Follows pattern: Single authoritative API integration with comprehensive threat coverage
- Touch points: Risk scoring system, threat intelligence pipeline

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Google Safe Browsing Integration**: System integrates with Google Safe Browsing API v4
   - URL threat detection using Google's comprehensive threat database
   - Support for multiple threat types (malware, social engineering, unwanted software, potentially harmful applications)
   - Real-time threat status checking with high accuracy
   - Platform-specific threat detection (any_platform, all_platforms, windows, linux, android, etc.)

2. **Threat Classification**: System processes Safe Browsing threat verdicts
   - Malware detection and classification
   - Phishing and social engineering identification
   - Unwanted software detection
   - Potentially harmful application identification

3. **Reputation Scoring**: System converts Safe Browsing data to risk scores
   - High-confidence scoring based on Google's authoritative data
   - Threat severity assessment based on threat type
   - Platform-specific risk evaluation
   - Clear safe/unsafe determination with confidence levels

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Accepts URLs from validation system for Safe Browsing reputation checking
5. Provides authoritative reputation score to overall risk assessment
6. Caches Safe Browsing results with 24-hour TTL for efficiency
7. Handles Google API rate limits (10,000 requests/day default quota)

**Quality Requirements:**

8. API integration includes proper Google API key authentication and error handling
9. Response time under 2 seconds for Safe Browsing reputation analysis
10. Standardized threat response processing for consistent risk scoring
11. Comprehensive logging for Safe Browsing verdicts and scoring decisions

## Technical Notes

- **Primary API**: Google Safe Browsing API v4
- **Endpoint**: https://safebrowsing.googleapis.com/v4/threatMatches:find
- **Authentication**: API key parameter authentication
- **Rate Limiting**: 10,000 requests/day (default), higher quotas available
- **Data Processing**: Process threat match responses and platform-specific verdicts

## Definition of Done

- [x] Google Safe Browsing API integration retrieves and processes threat verdicts
- [x] Threat type classification handles all Safe Browsing threat categories
- [x] Reputation scoring converts Safe Browsing data to standardized risk scores
- [x] Response caching implemented with 24-hour TTL
- [x] Google API rate limiting and quota management functional
- [x] Error handling provides graceful degradation for API failures
- [x] Unit tests cover Safe Browsing response processing and scoring logic
- [x] Integration tests validate Google Safe Browsing API interactions
- [x] Performance meets sub-2-second response time requirements
- [x] Documentation includes Google API configuration and threat scoring methodology

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Single API dependency on Google Safe Browsing service
- **Mitigation**: Robust error handling, caching for service outages, clear fallback messaging
- **Rollback**: System can operate with reduced reputation coverage if Google API fails

## Testing Requirements

- Test with known malicious URLs and clean URLs from Google's threat database
- Test with URLs having different threat types (malware, phishing, unwanted software)
- Test Google API error scenarios and fallback behavior
- Test rate limiting and quota management for Google API
- Test threat type classification and risk scoring accuracy
- Performance testing under concurrent Safe Browsing requests
- Integration testing with actual Google Safe Browsing API

## Reputation Scoring Framework

**High Risk (70-100):**
- Google Safe Browsing identifies as malware
- Confirmed phishing or social engineering threat
- Flagged as unwanted software distribution
- Multiple threat types detected

**Medium Risk (30-69):**
- Potentially harmful application detected
- Single threat type with platform-specific risks
- Historical threats with current uncertainty
- Suspicious patterns requiring caution

**Low Risk (0-29):**
- Clean status from Google Safe Browsing
- No historical threats in Google's database
- Verified safe across all threat categories
- Consistently clean reputation over time

## Data Points to Collect

- Google Safe Browsing: Threat types, platform targets, threat entry metadata, cache duration
- Threat Classification: Malware, social engineering, unwanted software, potentially harmful apps
- Risk Assessment: Overall reputation score, confidence level, threat severity
- Metadata: API response timestamp, cache status, quota usage, error conditions
