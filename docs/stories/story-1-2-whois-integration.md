# Story 1-2: WHOIS Integration & Domain Age Analysis

## User Story

As a **scam detection system**,
I want **to retrieve and analyze domain registration data via Node.js WHOIS library**,
So that **I can assess domain age and registration patterns as risk indicators**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Story 1-1 URL parsing system
- Technology: Node.js WHOIS library integration, Next.js API routes
- Follows pattern: External API integration with error handling
- Touch points: Risk scoring system, caching layer

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **WHOIS Library Integration**: System integrates with Node.js WHOIS library
   - Direct WHOIS protocol queries to authoritative servers
   - Built-in retry logic for network timeouts
   - Support for multiple TLD WHOIS servers
   - No external API dependencies or costs

2. **Domain Age Calculation**: System calculates accurate domain age metrics
   - Creation date extraction from WHOIS data
   - Age calculation in days, months, and years
   - Special handling for domains with missing creation dates
   - Identification of recently registered domains (< 30 days)

3. **Registration Pattern Analysis**: System analyzes registration metadata
   - Registrar information and reputation scoring
   - Nameserver patterns and hosting provider identification
   - Registration location and jurisdiction analysis
   - Privacy protection status detection

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Accepts parsed domain from URL validation system
5. Provides structured domain age data to risk scoring system
6. Caches WHOIS results with appropriate TTL (24 hours)
7. Handles API failures gracefully with degraded functionality

**Quality Requirements:**

8. API integration includes proper error handling and retries
9. Response time under 2 seconds for cached results, 5 seconds for fresh queries
10. Data normalization handles different WHOIS response formats
11. Logging captures API usage and error rates for monitoring

## Technical Notes

- **Primary Library**: Node.js WHOIS library for direct WHOIS queries
- **Fallback Strategy**: Built-in WHOIS server failover within library
- **Caching Strategy**: In-memory cache with 24-hour TTL for WHOIS data
- **Data Processing**: Extract and normalize key fields from WHOIS responses
- **Query Management**: Built-in timeout and retry handling

## Definition of Done

- [ ] WHOIS API integration functional with primary and backup providers
- [ ] Domain age calculation accurate for various domain types
- [ ] Registration pattern analysis extracts relevant risk indicators
- [ ] Response caching implemented with appropriate TTL
- [ ] Error handling provides graceful degradation
- [ ] API rate limiting compliance implemented
- [ ] Unit tests cover all WHOIS data scenarios
- [ ] Integration tests validate API interactions
- [ ] Performance meets response time requirements
- [ ] Documentation includes API configuration and troubleshooting

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: WHOIS server timeouts affecting domain age analysis
- **Mitigation**: Library built-in retry logic and cached data usage
- **Rollback**: System operates without domain age scoring if all providers fail

## Testing Requirements

- Test with domains of various ages (new, old, expired)
- Test with different TLDs and registration patterns
- Test API error scenarios and fallback behavior
- Test rate limiting and quota management
- Test data normalization across different WHOIS formats
- Performance testing under concurrent requests
- Integration testing with actual WHOIS providers

## Data Points to Extract

- Domain creation date
- Domain expiration date
- Last updated date
- Registrar information
- Nameservers
- Registration status
- Privacy protection status
- Administrative contact country (if available)
