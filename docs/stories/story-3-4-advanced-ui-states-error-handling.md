# Story 3-4: Advanced UI States & Error Handling

## User Story

As a **user**,
I want **clear feedback during analysis and helpful error messages**,
So that **I understand what's happening and can resolve issues**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Story 3-3 Results Display and Story 3-2 URL Analysis Form
- Technology: Next.js, React, shadcn/ui components, Tailwind CSS
- Follows pattern: Progressive enhancement with graceful degradation
- Touch points: Loading states, error boundaries, user feedback systems

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Sophisticated Loading States**: Implement comprehensive loading indicators
   - Use shadcn/ui Skeleton components for content placeholders
   - Progressive loading stages ("Checking domain...", "Analyzing content...", "Generating report...")
   - Animated progress indicators showing analysis completion percentage
   - Time estimates and remaining time display for longer analyses

2. **Comprehensive Error Patterns**: Handle all error scenarios gracefully
   - Use shadcn/ui Alert components for different error types
   - Network errors with retry buttons and offline indicators
   - API rate limiting with clear explanation and retry timing
   - Invalid URL errors with format correction suggestions
   - Service unavailable errors with alternative action options

3. **Partial Results Display**: Show available data during degraded service
   - Display completed analysis sections when others fail
   - Clear indicators for missing or unavailable data sections
   - Explanation of why certain data is unavailable
   - Option to retry individual analysis components

4. **Retry Mechanisms**: Provide multiple recovery options
   - Automatic retry with exponential backoff for transient errors
   - Manual retry buttons for user-initiated recovery attempts
   - Fallback to cached results when available
   - Alternative analysis methods when primary service fails

5. **Toast Notifications**: Implement user feedback system
   - Success notifications for completed analyses
   - Warning notifications for partial results
   - Error notifications with actionable next steps
   - Progress notifications for long-running operations

**Quality Requirements:**

6. **Error Boundary Implementation**: Prevent application crashes
   - React error boundaries around critical components
   - Graceful fallback UI for unexpected errors
   - Error reporting and logging integration
   - Recovery options and navigation back to working state

7. **Accessibility in Error States**: Ensure errors are accessible
   - Screen reader announcements for error states
   - Keyboard navigation for error recovery actions
   - High contrast error indicators
   - Clear focus management during error scenarios

## Technical Notes

- **Components**: Skeleton, Alert, Toast, Progress components from shadcn/ui
- **Error Handling**: React error boundaries and try-catch patterns
- **State Management**: Error states, loading states, retry logic
- **Notifications**: Toast system with queue management
- **Accessibility**: ARIA live regions for dynamic content updates

## Definition of Done

- [x] Sophisticated loading states with Skeleton components implemented

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Complex error handling confusing users with too many options
- **Mitigation**: User testing to optimize error message clarity and action priorities
- **Rollback**: Simplified error handling with basic retry functionality

## Testing Requirements

- Test all loading states with various analysis duration scenarios
- Test comprehensive error scenarios (network, API, validation, service)
- Test partial results display with mixed success/failure conditions
- Test retry mechanisms with both automatic and manual triggers
- Test toast notification system with multiple concurrent notifications
- Test error boundaries with simulated component failures
- Test accessibility with screen readers during error states
- Performance testing to ensure error handling doesn't block UI

## UI/UX Specifications

**Skeleton Loading Design:**
- Shimmer animation effect matching content structure
- Proper sizing to match expected content dimensions
- Smooth transition from skeleton to actual content
- Progressive revelation as different analysis sections complete

**Error Alert Patterns:**
- **Network Errors**: Red alert with wifi icon and retry button
- **API Errors**: Yellow alert with warning icon and help link
- **Validation Errors**: Blue alert with info icon and correction guidance
- **Service Errors**: Orange alert with service icon and status link

**Toast Notification Design:**
- Maximum 3 toasts visible simultaneously
- Auto-dismiss after 5 seconds unless action required
- Swipe-to-dismiss functionality on mobile
- Clear visual hierarchy for different notification types

**Partial Results Layout:**
- Available sections displayed normally
- Missing sections shown with dashed borders and explanation
- "Retry Missing" button for individual section recovery
- Overall completion percentage indicator

## Accessibility Features

- **Loading States**: Screen reader announcements for progress updates
- **Error Messages**: ARIA live regions for dynamic error updates
- **Retry Actions**: Clear keyboard shortcuts and focus management
- **Toast Notifications**: Proper roles and keyboard dismissal
- **Visual Indicators**: High contrast colors and icon alternatives
- **Focus Management**: Logical focus flow during error recovery

## Integration Points

**Frontend Integration:**
- Connects with all analysis components from Stories 3-2 and 3-3
- Integrates with navigation and routing for error recovery
- Links with caching system for fallback data
- Coordinates with loading states across application

**Backend Integration:**
- Handles all API error responses with appropriate UI feedback
- Integrates with error logging and monitoring services
- Manages retry logic coordination with backend rate limiting
- Processes partial response data for degraded service display
