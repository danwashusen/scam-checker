# Story 1-5: Caching & Performance Layer

## User Story

As a **system performance optimizer**,
I want **intelligent caching and performance optimization for API results**,
So that **the application provides fast responses while minimizing external API costs and respecting rate limits**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: All Epic 1 stories (URL validation, WHOIS, SSL, reputation APIs)
- Technology: In-memory caching (Redis or Node.js Map), performance monitoring
- Follows pattern: Cache-aside pattern with TTL management
- Touch points: All external API integrations, response time optimization

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Multi-Layer Caching System**: Implement comprehensive caching strategy
   - In-memory cache for frequently accessed data (LRU eviction)
   - Distributed cache support for horizontal scaling
   - Cache key generation based on URL normalization
   - Hierarchical caching (URL-level and domain-level data)

2. **TTL Management**: Implement appropriate cache expiration policies
   - WHOIS data: 24-hour TTL (domain registration changes infrequently)
   - SSL certificates: 12-hour TTL (certificates can be updated)
   - Reputation data: 6-hour TTL (threat intelligence changes frequently)
   - URL analysis results: 4-hour TTL (comprehensive analysis caching)

3. **Cache Performance Optimization**: Optimize cache efficiency and hit rates
   - Cache warming for popular domains
   - Background cache refresh before expiration
   - Intelligent cache eviction based on usage patterns
   - Cache statistics and hit rate monitoring

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Integrates seamlessly with all external API components
5. Provides cache statistics to monitoring and analytics systems
6. Supports cache invalidation for specific URLs or domains
7. Handles cache failures gracefully with direct API fallback

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Cache operations add less than 10ms to response times
9. Cache hit rate exceeds 60% for repeated URL analyses
10. Memory usage remains stable under high load conditions
11. Comprehensive logging for cache performance and debugging

## Technical Notes

- **Primary Cache**: Node.js Map with LRU eviction for simplicity
- **Future Scaling**: Redis integration for distributed caching
- **Key Strategy**: Hash-based keys using normalized URLs and domains
- **Memory Management**: Configurable cache size limits and monitoring
- **Performance Monitoring**: Cache hit rates, response times, memory usage

- **Rollback**: System can operate without caching with direct API calls

## Testing Requirements

- Test cache hit and miss scenarios
- Test TTL expiration and refresh logic
- Test memory usage under sustained load
- Test cache eviction policies (LRU behavior)
- Test cache invalidation functionality
- Test graceful degradation on cache failures
- Performance testing for cache operation overhead
- Load testing for concurrent cache access

## Cache Strategy Details

**Cache Layers:**
1. **L1 Cache**: In-memory URL analysis results (most expensive operations)
2. **L2 Cache**: Domain-level data (WHOIS, base reputation) 
3. **L3 Cache**: SSL certificate data (intermediate update frequency)

**Cache Keys:**
- URL Analysis: `url:${normalizedURL}:${timestamp}`
- Domain Data: `domain:${domain}:whois|ssl|reputation`
- Reputation: `reputation:${url}:${provider}`

**Performance Targets:**
- Cache lookup: < 5ms
- Cache write: < 10ms
- Hit rate: > 60%
- Memory usage: < 512MB for 10,000 cached entries

## Monitoring Requirements

- Cache hit rate by data type
- Average response time with/without cache
- Memory usage patterns and growth
- Cache eviction frequency and patterns
- API cost reduction metrics
- Error rates for cache operations
