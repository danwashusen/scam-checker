# Story 2-3: Risk Categorization & Thresholds

## User Story

As a **risk assessment system**,
I want **clear color-coded risk categories with configurable thresholds**,
So that **users receive intuitive visual indicators and appropriate recommendations for different risk levels**.

## Story Context

**System Integration:**
- Integrates with: Stories 2-1 (scoring algorithm) and 2-2 (AI content analysis)
- Technology: Configuration management system, risk categorization logic
- Follows pattern: Rule-based categorization with configurable parameters
- Touch points: User interface, explanation system, recommendation engine

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Risk Category Definition**: Implement three-tier risk categorization
   - **Green (Safe)**: Scores 0-30 - Low risk, minimal warnings
   - **Yellow (Caution)**: Scores 31-70 - Medium risk, proceed with caution
   - **Red (Danger)**: Scores 71-100 - High risk, strong warnings

2. **Configurable Thresholds**: Allow risk threshold adjustment
   - Administrative interface for threshold configuration
   - A/B testing support with different threshold sets
   - Historical threshold performance tracking
   - Emergency threshold adjustment for emerging threats

3. **Recommendation Engine**: Generate appropriate actions for each category
   - Green: "Site appears safe" with standard browsing recommendations
   - Yellow: "Exercise caution" with specific warnings and precautions
   - Red: "High risk detected" with strong avoidance recommendations

**Integration Requirements:**

4. Receives risk scores from multi-factor scoring algorithm
5. Provides categorization data to user interface components
6. Supports threshold override for specific domains or patterns
7. Integrates with explanation system for category-specific messaging

**Quality Requirements:**

8. Risk categorization processes in under 10ms
9. Threshold configuration changes take effect immediately
10. Category assignments remain consistent across user sessions
11. Comprehensive logging for threshold performance analysis

## Technical Notes

- **Default Thresholds**: Green (0-30), Yellow (31-70), Red (71-100)
- **Configuration Storage**: Environment variables with database override capability
- **Performance**: In-memory threshold caching for fast categorization
- **Validation**: Threshold changes validated against historical accuracy data
- **Emergency Response**: Rapid threshold adjustment for zero-day threats

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Three-tier risk categorization system implemented
- [ ] Configurable threshold system with administrative controls
- [ ] Recommendation engine provides appropriate guidance for each category
- [ ] Integration with scoring algorithm and user interface completed
- [ ] Threshold configuration interface accessible to administrators
- [ ] Performance meets sub-10ms categorization requirements
- [ ] Unit tests cover all categorization scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Configuration validation prevents invalid threshold settings
- [ ] Historical performance tracking enables threshold optimization
- [ ] Documentation includes threshold tuning guidance

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Incorrect thresholds leading to false sense of security or excessive warnings
- **Mitigation**: Continuous performance monitoring with automated threshold recommendations
- **Rollback**: Quick threshold reversion capability for emergency corrections

## Testing Requirements

- Test categorization accuracy with known URL datasets
- Test threshold configuration and immediate effect implementation
- Test edge cases around threshold boundaries (scores 30, 31, 70, 71)
- Test recommendation appropriateness for each risk category
- Test threshold override functionality for specific use cases
- Performance testing for categorization speed under load
- Validation testing for threshold optimization accuracy

## Risk Category Details

**Green (Safe) - Scores 0-30:**
- **Indicators**: Long-established domains, clean reputation, strong SSL
- **Message**: "This site appears to be safe based on our analysis."
- **Recommendations**: Standard browsing precautions apply
- **UI**: Green badge, minimal warnings, detailed analysis available

**Yellow (Caution) - Scores 31-70:**
- **Indicators**: Mixed signals, some risk factors present, uncertain reputation
- **Message**: "Exercise caution when visiting this site."
- **Recommendations**: Avoid entering sensitive information, verify site legitimacy
- **UI**: Yellow badge, clear warnings, prominent risk factors displayed

**Red (Danger) - Scores 71-100:**
- **Indicators**: Multiple risk factors, known threats, recent malicious activity
- **Message**: "High risk detected - we recommend avoiding this site."
- **Recommendations**: Do not enter personal information, consider alternative sources
- **UI**: Red badge, prominent warnings, detailed threat information

## Threshold Optimization Framework

**Performance Metrics:**
- True positive rate by category
- False positive rate by category
- User satisfaction with recommendations
- Click-through rates after warnings

**Optimization Process:**
1. Weekly analysis of threshold performance
2. A/B testing of alternative thresholds
3. Machine learning recommendations for threshold adjustment
4. Expert review of threshold changes

**Emergency Adjustments:**
- Rapid response capability for emerging threats
- Temporary threshold lowering for specific attack campaigns
- Automated threshold suggestions based on threat intelligence feeds
