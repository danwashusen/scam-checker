# Security and Performance

## Security Requirements

**Frontend Security:**
- CSP Headers: Strict Content Security Policy without unsafe-inline or unsafe-eval
- XSS Prevention: React's built-in escaping + input sanitization with DOMPurify
- Secure Storage: No sensitive data in localStorage; session data in memory only

**Backend Security:**
- Input Validation: Zod schema validation on all API inputs
- Rate Limiting: API Gateway throttling - 100 requests/second burst, 50 requests/second sustained
- CORS Policy: Strict origin allowlist - production frontend domain only

## Performance Optimization

**Frontend Performance:**
- Bundle Size Target: < 200KB gzipped for initial load
- Loading Strategy: Code splitting by route, lazy loading for technical details
- Caching Strategy: CloudFront edge caching for static assets (1 year)

**Backend Performance:**
- Response Time Target: < 3 seconds for complete analysis
- Caching Strategy: NoOp cache initially, future DynamoDB with 24-hour TTL
