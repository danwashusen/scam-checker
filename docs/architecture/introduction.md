# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Scam Checker Web App**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

Based on your PRD, this is a **brownfield project** built on **Next.js foundation** that's already been initialized. This provides several architectural advantages:

- **Next.js Full-Stack Framework** - Unified frontend/backend with API routes
- **Built-in Serverless Support** - Perfect for AWS deployment strategy  
- **Optimized Performance** - Server-side rendering and static optimization
- **TypeScript Ready** - Type safety across full stack

**Analysis:** The Next.js foundation aligns perfectly with your dual-user experience requirements (simple UI + technical details) and serverless AWS deployment strategy.
