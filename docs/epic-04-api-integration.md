# Epic 4: API & Integration

## Epic Goal

Implement a robust REST API endpoint (/api/analyze) for programmatic access by developers, complete with authentication, rate limiting, comprehensive documentation, and proper error handling for production-ready integration.

## Epic Description

**System Context:**
- Next.js API routes serving both web UI and external developers
- Integration with all analysis components from previous epics
- Production-ready API with proper security and monitoring
- Developer-focused documentation and tooling

**Enhancement Details:**

This epic creates the external-facing API that enables developers to integrate scam checking into their own applications, completing the platform's dual-user approach.

**What's being built:**
- RESTful API endpoint for URL analysis with standard HTTP methods
- Request/response schema with proper JSON structure
- Authentication and authorization system (API keys)
- Rate limiting and quota management per API user
- Comprehensive API documentation with examples
- Developer onboarding flow and key management
- Error handling with meaningful HTTP status codes
- API versioning and backward compatibility
- Monitoring and analytics for API usage

**Success criteria:**
- Developers can easily integrate URL analysis into their applications
- API provides consistent, well-documented responses
- Authentication and rate limiting prevent abuse
- Error messages help developers troubleshoot integration issues
- API performance meets SLA requirements for external usage
- Documentation enables self-service developer adoption

## Stories

1. **Story 4-1:** Core API Endpoint Implementation - Build /api/analyze endpoint with proper request/response handling
2. **Story 4-2:** Authentication & API Key Management - Implement API key system with user management and permissions
3. **Story 4-3:** Rate Limiting & Quota System - Add rate limiting, quotas, and usage tracking for API consumers
4. **Story 4-4:** API Documentation & Developer Portal - Create comprehensive API docs with interactive examples
5. **Story 4-5:** Monitoring & Analytics - Implement API usage monitoring, error tracking, and performance analytics

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] RESTful API design following OpenAPI 3.0 specification
- [ ] JSON request/response format with proper schema validation
- [ ] API key authentication with secure key generation and storage
- [ ] Configurable rate limiting (requests per minute/hour/day)
- [ ] Usage quotas with automatic reset cycles
- [ ] Proper HTTP status codes and error message structure
- [ ] Request/response logging for debugging and analytics
- [ ] API versioning support (v1 as initial version)
- [ ] CORS configuration for browser-based integrations

## Security Requirements

- [ ] API key encryption and secure storage
- [ ] Input validation and sanitization for all endpoints
- [ ] Rate limiting to prevent abuse and DoS attacks
- [ ] Request size limits and timeout protection
- [ ] Audit logging for security monitoring
- [ ] HTTPS enforcement for all API communications

## Documentation Requirements

- [ ] OpenAPI specification with complete schema definitions
- [ ] Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI or similar)
- [ ] Code examples in multiple programming languages
- [ ] Error handling guide with troubleshooting tips
- [ ] Rate limiting and quota documentation
- [ ] Getting started guide for new developers
- [ ] API changelog and versioning information

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** API abuse leading to excessive costs from external service calls
- **Mitigation:** Strict rate limiting, usage monitoring, and emergency circuit breakers
- **Rollback Plan:** API can be temporarily disabled while maintaining web interface functionality

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] API endpoint fully functional with comprehensive testing
- [ ] Authentication system secure and properly tested
- [ ] Rate limiting validated under load conditions
- [ ] Documentation complete and developer-tested
- [ ] Monitoring dashboards operational
- [ ] Security audit passed for production readiness
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet SLA requirements
