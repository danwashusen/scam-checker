# Epic 5: Build & Deployment Infrastructure

## Epic Goal

Establish production-ready build, deployment, and monitoring infrastructure on AWS using serverless technologies to ensure reliable, scalable, and cost-effective operation of the scam checker application.

## Epic Description

**System Context:**
- Next.js application requiring serverless deployment architecture
- AWS platform with focus on serverless technologies for cost efficiency
- Production-grade infrastructure with monitoring, logging, and security
- CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment

**Enhancement Details:**

This epic creates the foundational infrastructure necessary to deploy, monitor, and maintain the scam checker application in a production environment. It focuses on AWS serverless technologies to minimize operational overhead while ensuring scalability and reliability.

**What's being built:**
- AWS serverless deployment architecture (Lambda, API Gateway, CloudFront)
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment
- Environment management (development, staging, production)
- Infrastructure as Code using AWS CDK or Terraform
- Monitoring, logging, and alerting systems
- Security implementation (WAF, security headers, encryption)
- Cost optimization and scaling policies

**Success criteria:**
- Application deploys reliably to AWS with zero-downtime updates
- Infrastructure scales automatically based on demand
- Comprehensive monitoring provides visibility into performance and errors
- Security measures protect against common web application threats
- Cost optimization keeps operational expenses within budget
- Disaster recovery and backup procedures are operational
