# Epic 0: Project Foundation & Local Development Setup

## Epic Goal

Establish the complete project directory structure, initialize all development environments, and configure local development workflows to enable efficient development across frontend, backend, and infrastructure components.

## Epic Description

**System Context:**
- New Next.js project that needs comprehensive development environment setup
- Multi-component architecture requiring organized directory structure
- Local development environment supporting frontend, backend, and infrastructure work
- Integration with existing PRD and architecture documentation

**Enhancement Details:**

This epic creates the foundational project structure and development environment necessary for all subsequent development work. It establishes consistent patterns, tooling, and workflows that will be used throughout the entire development process.

**What's being built:**
- Complete project directory structure with organized code separation
- Next.js frontend initialization with TypeScript and required dependencies
- Local backend development environment with serverless emulation
- Build and development scripts for efficient local workflows
- Development tooling (linting, formatting, testing setup)
- Documentation structure with README files for each component
- Environment configuration and secrets management
- Git workflow setup with appropriate ignore patterns

**Success criteria:**
- Complete project structure enables organized development
- Local development environment supports all application components
- Build scripts enable efficient development and testing workflows
- Documentation provides clear guidance for each project area
- Development tooling ensures code quality and consistency
- Environment setup enables seamless team collaboration

## Stories

1. **Story 0-1:** Project Directory Structure & Documentation - Create organized folder structure with comprehensive README files
2. **Story 0-2:** Next.js Frontend Initialization - Set up Next.js with TypeScript, Tailwind, and required dependencies
3. **Story 0-3:** Backend Development Environment - Configure local serverless development with AWS SAM or Serverless Framework
4. **Story 0-4:** Build Scripts & Development Workflows - Create package.json scripts for development, testing, and building
5. **Story 0-5:** Development Tooling & Code Quality - Set up linting, formatting, testing frameworks, and git hooks
6. **Story 0-6:** End-to-End Service Testing Implementation - Create comprehensive E2E tests for all external service integrations
7. **Story 0-7:** Frontend UI Foundation Bootstrap - Implement responsive, accessible frontend interface with theme system and navigation

## Technical Requirements

- [ ] Organized directory structure supporting all application components
- [ ] Next.js frontend with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui
- [ ] Local serverless development environment for backend testing
- [ ] Comprehensive build scripts for all development tasks
- [ ] Code quality tools (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- [ ] Testing framework setup (Jest, React Testing Library, Cypress)
- [ ] End-to-end service testing for external API integrations
- [ ] Comprehensive frontend UI foundation with theme system
- [ ] Environment variable management for local development
- [ ] Git configuration with appropriate ignore patterns
- [ ] Documentation structure with clear component descriptions

## Project Structure Requirements

- [ ] Frontend components organized by feature and reusability
- [ ] Backend API routes clearly separated and organized
- [ ] Shared utilities and types accessible across components
- [ ] Infrastructure code isolated and version controlled
- [ ] Documentation co-located with relevant code
- [ ] Test files organized parallel to source code
- [ ] E2E service tests organized separately from unit tests
- [ ] UI components using shadcn/ui design system consistently
- [ ] Configuration files properly organized and documented

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk**: Poorly organized project structure leading to technical debt and development inefficiency
- **Mitigation**: Follow established Next.js and serverless best practices, comprehensive documentation
- **Rollback**: Project structure can be reorganized as needs become clearer

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Project directory structure supports all planned application components
- [ ] Next.js frontend fully initialized and functional locally
- [ ] Backend development environment supports serverless local testing
- [ ] Build scripts enable efficient development workflows
- [ ] Development tooling enforces code quality standards
- [ ] E2E service tests implemented for external API integrations
- [ ] Frontend UI foundation with responsive design and theme system
- [ ] Documentation provides clear guidance for each project area
- [ ] Environment configuration supports local development
- [ ] Git workflow configured for team collaboration
- [ ] Local development environment validated end-to-end

## Success Metrics

- **Setup Time**: New developer can get fully functional local environment in < 15 minutes
- **Build Performance**: Local development builds complete in < 30 seconds
- **Test Execution**: Unit test suite runs in < 10 seconds, E2E service tests complete in < 5 minutes
- **Code Quality**: 100% of code passes linting and formatting standards
- **Frontend Performance**: Lighthouse score >80 for performance, accessibility score > 90
- **Service Integration**: E2E tests pass rate > 90% in CI, external service failures detected
- **Documentation Coverage**: Every major directory has descriptive README
